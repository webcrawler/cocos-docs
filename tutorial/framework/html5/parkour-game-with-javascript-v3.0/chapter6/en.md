# Add Chipmunk Physic Engine to Our Game

## Introduction
Cocos2d-JS can give us the power to create impressive game world. But it lacks some sort of realistic.
Though we can do complex compute to make the game world more realistic, but there is an another option
which can ease our life. The answer is *physic engine*.

Physic engine provides gravity, collide detection and physic simulation which can make our game world looks more realistic.

In this tutorial, we will introduce Chipmunk physics engine into our parkour game.

##Why Chipmunk Physics?
Why should we choose Chipmunk physic engine? Because it is give us much more power than any other 2D physics engine.

Despite Chipmunk physic engine, there is another option - Box2D.

Box2D is a nice 2D physic engine and it has been existed for a very long time. Many 2d games have been using Box2D for their game physics.

But Chipmunk has it's own advantages. You can go to Chipmunk's [website](http://chipmunk-physics.net/) for more information.


##Enable Chipmunk Physic in Cocos2d-JS

### Preparation

At first, let's enable Chipmunk in Cocos2d-JS.

Open *project.json* file, and modify:

```
 "modules" : ["cocos2d"],
 ```

to:

```
 "modules" : ["cocos2d","chipmunk"],
 ```

Thus, when Cocos2d-JS finish launching, it will load Chipmunk library automatically.

Next, let's create a new file named *globals.js* and add two global variables into it.

```
var g_groundHeight = 57;
var g_runnerStartX = 80;
```

At last, we should tell the framework to load *globals.js* file when engine launches.
Append *globals.js* path to the end of *jsList* array:

```
    "jsList" : [
        "src/resource.js",
        "src/app.js",
        "src/AnimationLayer.js",
        "src/BackgroundLayer.js",
        "src/PlayScene.js",
        "src/StatusLayer.js",
        "src/globals.js"

    ]
```

*Note:* Whenever you add a new file in Cocos2d-JS, you should remember to add it to the *jsList* array.

### Initialize Chipmunk physic world

In Chipmunk, there is a *space* object to represent the physic world.

At first, let's add a new member variable named *space*  in *PlayScene.js* file:

```
space:null,
```

In general, one game needs only a *space* object. The space object can be shared by different layers.
We usually put the *space initialize code* in PlayScene.

Here is the code to setup the physic world:

```
    // init space of chipmunk
    initPhysics:function() {
        //1. new space object 
        this.space = new cp.Space();
        //2. setup the  Gravity
        this.space.gravity = cp.v(0, -350);

        // 3. set up Walls
        var wallBottom = new cp.SegmentShape(this.space.staticBody,
            cp.v(0, g_groundHeight),// start point
            cp.v(4294967295, g_groundHeight),// MAX INT:4294967295
            0);// thickness of wall
        this.space.addStaticShape(wallBottom);
    },
```

The above code is self-explanatory so we can safely leave it out. If you want to know the details of these API, you should
refer to Chipmunk's official documentation for more information.

Next, let's define our game's main loop:

```
    update:function (dt) {
        // chipmunk step
        this.space.step(dt);
    }
```

In the *update* function, we tell Chipmunk start to simulate physics.

Before we go any further, let's add a minor change to *AnimationLayer*. Since we will create physic actor in AnimationLayer, so
we should modify the constructor of AnimationLayer to pass the *space* object in.

```
ctor:function (space) {
        this._super();
        this.space = space;
        this.init();
    },
```

Of course, we should define a weak ref member variable in AnimationLayer and initialize it to *null*.

Thus our preparation work has been done. let's wrap the end and call these method in *onEnter* function:

```
    onEnter:function () {
        this._super();
        this.initPhysics();

        this.addChild(new BackgroundLayer());
        this.addChild(new AnimationLayer(this.space));
        this.addChild(new StatusLayer());

        this.scheduleUpdate();
    },
```
**Note**
You should initilize the space of physics and pass it to AnimationLayer.

### Add Physics Component to the Runner Sprite

In the last tutorial, we create the runner by using spritsheet. In this section, we will rewrite the runner by using *PhysicsSprite*.

The PhysicsSprite is a reusable component which can combine the physic body with a cocos2d sprite.

Here is the code to create the runner with PhysicsSprite:

```
        //1. create PhysicsSprite with a sprite frame name
        this.sprite = new cc.PhysicsSprite("#runner0.png");
        var contentSize = this.sprite.getContentSize();
        // 2. init the runner physic body
        this.body = new cp.Body(1, cp.momentForBox(1, contentSize.width, contentSize.height));
        //3. set the position of the runner
        this.body.p = cc.p(g_runnerStartX, g_groundHeight + contentSize.height / 2);
        //4. apply impulse to the body
        this.body.applyImpulse(cp.v(150, 0), cp.v(0, 0));//run speed
        //5. add the created body to space
        this.space.addBody(this.body);
        //6. create the shape for the body
        this.shape = new cp.BoxShape(this.body, contentSize.width - 14, contentSize.height);
        //7. add shape to space
        this.space.addShape(this.shape);
        //8. set body to the physic sprite
        this.sprite.setBody(this.body);
```

The code and comment are self-explanatory. Add these code in *AnimationLayer*'s *init* method.


### Debug and Test

Congratulations. You have done all the bolts and nuts. You can just press the *debug* button within *Webstorm*.

![run](res/run.png)

Now you can see the runner run pass through the screen.

##Summary

In this tutorial, we have show you how to setup Chipmunk physic world, how to setup the physic world boundary, how to create a rigid body and the associated
shape. we also add physics to sprite to make it act more realistic. You can grab the entire source code from [here](res/Parkour.zip).


##Where to go from here

In the next tutorial, we will introduce the camera movement into the game. And we will also replace the background image with tiledMap.
More importantly we will make the background infinite loop displayed in the game. Keep tuning with the next tutorial.
